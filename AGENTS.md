# AGENTS.md — openclaw-dev

Guidance for AI coding agents (Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI,
Amp, and others) working in this repository.

This repo deploys **OpenClaw** as a secure, hosted AI assistant on **Azure
Container Apps** (default) or **ACA Sandbox** (opt-in), wired to **Azure OpenAI in Foundry Models** over a **Managed
Identity** (no API keys), gated by **Entra ID Easy Auth**, with an optional
**Microsoft Teams** channel. Alpha, single-tenant, dev/test.

## Start here

For any deploy / configure / operate / Teams / troubleshoot / teardown request,
follow the full playbook in **[`skills/openclaw-on-azure/SKILL.md`](skills/openclaw-on-azure/SKILL.md)**.
It contains the command map, env-var contract, region list, and error catalog.

## Non-negotiable rules

- **Single entrypoint:** use `./devclaw <cmd>` (Windows `.\devclaw.cmd <cmd>`),
  a thin wrapper over the Azure Developer CLI (`azd`). Fall back to `azd` directly
  only if the wrapper can't run.
- **Configure with `azd env set <KEY> <VALUE>`** before `devclaw up`. There is no
  `.env` file. Model/version/capacity live in `infra/main.bicep`, not env vars.
- **Teams is opt-in.** Default deploy is browser-only (no bot, no Teams). To
  enable the Teams add-on: `azd env set ENABLE_TEAMS true` then re-run
  `devclaw up` (or just run `devclaw teams`, which prompts and re-provisions).
  Don't create bot app registrations by default.
- **Restricted subscriptions/tenants:** before `devclaw up`, set whichever of
  these apply: `SERVICE_MANAGEMENT_REFERENCE=<smr-guid>` (tenants that
  require it on new app regs), `SKIP_STORAGE=true` (subscriptions whose Azure
  Policy blocks shared-key storage — ACA file mounts need shared keys today;
  gateway token + sessions won't persist across replica restarts). ACR admin
  is already disabled; Container Apps uses managed identity for model RBAC.
- **Region** `AZURE_LOCATION` must be in the allowed list in `infra/main.bicep`;
  set `AZURE_OPENAI_LOCATION` separately if that region lacks the model SKU.
- **Azure OpenAI only today** (default `gpt-5-mini`). Don't claim Claude / other
  Foundry Models work yet — they're future scope.
- **Passwordless:** model calls use Managed Identity (`disableLocalAuth: true`).
  Never add or suggest API keys.
- **Never commit secrets.** `_local/`, `.azure/`, `.azure-cli/`, `.azd-config/`,
  the generated `teams/package/manifest.json`, and `teams/openclaw-teams-app.zip`
  are gitignored.
- **Confirm before destructive actions** (`devclaw down`/`azd down`,
  `az ad app delete`, RBAC removal, deleting state): state what will be deleted and
  get explicit confirmation. Never use `--force`/`--no-prompt` to skip it.
- **To pause cheaply** use `devclaw stop` (scale to 0), not `down`.

## Verify

`devclaw status` should show `Running`; open the printed URL, sign in with a
Microsoft account, confirm the WebChat UI loads. `devclaw test` is only a status
summary, not an end-to-end model test.
